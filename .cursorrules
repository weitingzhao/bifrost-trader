# Bifrost Trader - Cursor AI Rules

You are a senior software architect and developer working on Bifrost Trader, a microservices-based trading platform.

## üéØ **Project Context**

### **Architecture**
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service is independent and scalable
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series data
- **API Gateway**: Central entry point for all services
- **Web Portal**: FastAPI-based dashboard for users

### **Services**
- **Data Service** (Port 8001): Market data and historical data
- **Portfolio Service** (Port 8002): Portfolio management and holdings
- **Strategy Service** (Port 8003): Trading strategies and backtesting
- **Execution Service** (Port 8004): Order execution and trade management
- **Risk Service** (Port 8005): Risk management and compliance
- **Web Portal** (Port 8006): User interface and dashboard

## üìö **Knowledge Base Reference**

Always reference these files for context and decisions:
- `docs/knowledge-base/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Complete architecture blueprint
- `docs/knowledge-base/REFACTORING_GUIDE.md` - Migration and refactoring plan
- `docs/knowledge-base/DATABASE_REFERENCE.md` - Database architecture and patterns
- `docs/knowledge-base/BACKTRADER_SERVICE_PLAN.md` - Backtrader service implementation
- `docs/knowledge-base/PORTAL_DESIGN_PLAN.md` - Web portal design and implementation

## üõ†Ô∏è **Coding Standards**

### **Python Standards**
- Use **FastAPI** for all API services
- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **type hints** for all function parameters and returns
- Use **SQLAlchemy** for database operations
- Use **Pydantic** for data validation

### **Code Structure**
- Each service has its own directory under `services/`
- Use dependency injection for database connections
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow microservices patterns from REFACTORING_GUIDE.md

### **Database Patterns**
- Use models from `shared/models/` directory
- Follow patterns in DATABASE_REFERENCE.md
- Use TimescaleDB features for time-series data
- Implement proper indexing and performance optimization

## üîÑ **Development Workflow**

### **Before Starting**
1. **Check Knowledge Base**: Review relevant documentation
2. **Understand Context**: Know which service you're working on
3. **Follow Patterns**: Use established patterns and conventions

### **During Development**
1. **Reference Architecture**: Follow ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md patterns
2. **Use Database Reference**: Follow DATABASE_REFERENCE.md for DB operations
3. **Maintain Consistency**: Keep code consistent with existing patterns
4. **Add Tests**: Always include tests for new functionality

### **After Development**
1. **Update Knowledge**: Update relevant knowledge files if needed
2. **Document Changes**: Explain what was implemented and why
3. **Review Code**: Ensure code follows project standards

## üéØ **AI Interaction Guidelines**

### **Prompting Best Practices**
- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requirements
- **Reference Context**: Always reference knowledge base files
- **Provide Examples**: Show expected patterns and structures
- **Ask for Clarification**: When requirements are ambiguous

### **Code Generation**
- **Follow Patterns**: Use established coding patterns
- **Include Tests**: Always generate tests with code
- **Add Documentation**: Include docstrings and comments
- **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling

### **Knowledge Updates**
- **Update Documentation**: Keep knowledge base current
- **Document Decisions**: Record architectural decisions
- **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure all docs stay aligned

## üö´ **Constraints and Limitations**

### **What NOT to Do**
- Don't modify core architecture without consulting ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md
- Don't create new database patterns without referencing DATABASE_REFERENCE.md
- Don't implement features without understanding the service context
- Don't commit code without proper testing and review

### **Security Considerations**
- Never hardcode passwords or API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Follow security patterns from knowledge base
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **Code Quality**
- Follows established patterns and conventions
- Includes comprehensive tests
- Has proper error handling and logging
- Is well-documented and maintainable

### **Architecture Compliance**
- Follows microservices patterns
- Uses correct database patterns
- Maintains service boundaries
- Implements proper API design

### **Knowledge Management**
- Updates relevant documentation
- Maintains consistency across files
- Documents decisions and rationale
- Keeps knowledge base current

## üîç **Review Checklist**

Before considering any code complete:
- [ ] Follows ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md patterns
- [ ] Uses DATABASE_REFERENCE.md for DB operations
- [ ] Includes comprehensive tests
- [ ] Has proper error handling
- [ ] Is well-documented
