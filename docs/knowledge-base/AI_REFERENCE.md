## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE & IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

**IMPORTANT:** Before suggesting any new features or answering questions about project structure, 
ALWAYS reference `docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` first.

This document contains:
- Current implementation status (what exists vs. what's missing)
- Target microservices architecture
- Migration plan and priorities
- Critical safety requirements
- Hardware allocation strategy

**Critical Missing Components (DO NOT ASSUME THEY EXIST):**
- Advanced Risk Management System (VaR, drawdown monitoring, correlation analysis)
- Compliance & Regulatory framework (PDT rules, wash sales, audit trails)
- Advanced Analytics (TCA, performance attribution)
- Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
- Production Monitoring Stack

**Always verify component existence before suggesting usage.**
