## 🎯 **How to Use with Cursor AI**

### **1. Reference Specific Files**
When asking questions, reference specific knowledge files:
```
"Based on ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md, what's the next service to implement?"

"According to REFACTORING_GUIDE.md, how should I migrate the Portfolio Service from Smart Trader?"

"Using BACKTRADER_SERVICE_PLAN.md as reference, help me implement the strategy service API."
```

### **2. Context-Aware Questions**
Ask questions that leverage the comprehensive knowledge:
```
"What's the recommended tech stack for the Portfolio Service according to the architecture analysis?"

"How does the current web-portal implementation align with the portal design plan?"

"What are the database requirements for the Execution Service based on the architecture?"
```

### **3. Cross-Reference Information**
Ask for information that spans multiple documents:
```
"How does the database setup relate to the microservices architecture?"

"What's the implementation priority based on the project status analysis?"
```

## 🚀 **Current Project Status**

### **✅ Completed Services**
- **Web Portal Service** (Port 8006) - Complete with database integration
- **API Gateway Service** (Port 8000) - Complete with service routing
- **Database Infrastructure** - Complete PostgreSQL setup

### **🔄 Partially Complete**
- **Data Service** (Port 8001) - Basic structure, needs completion
- **Strategy Service** (Port 8003) - Backtrader framework, needs API layer

### **❌ Next Priority Services**
- **Portfolio Service** (Port 8002) - Critical for web-portal
- **Execution Service** (Port 8004) - Core trading functionality
- **Risk Service** (Port 8005) - Trading safety

## 🎯 **Best Practices**

### **1. Be Specific**
Instead of: "Help me with the project"
Use: "Based on REFACTORING_GUIDE.md, help me migrate the Portfolio Service from Smart Trader"

### **2. Reference Context**
Instead of: "What should I do next?"
Use: "According to ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md, what's the next critical task?"

### **3. Cross-Reference**
Instead of: "How do I set up the database?"
Use: "Using DATABASE_REFERENCE.md and ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md, help me configure the database for the Portfolio Service"
