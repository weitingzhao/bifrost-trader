## 🔍 **Reference to Smart Trader**

The bifrost-trader project maintains reference to the smart-trader codebase for:

1. **Model Migration**: Copying Django models to SQLAlchemy/Pydantic
2. **Business Logic**: Migrating service logic and calculations
3. **API Endpoints**: Converting Django views to FastAPI endpoints
4. **Database Schema**: Migrating database structures
5. **Configuration**: Adapting Django settings to service configs

### **Key Reference Files**
- `apps/common/models/` → Service-specific models
- `business/services/` → Service business logic
- `business/engines/` → Data processing engines
- `apps/tasks/` → Async task implementations
- `home/views/` → API endpoint logic

## 📚 **Documentation**

- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI specs
- **Service Documentation**: Individual service READMEs
- **Migration Guide**: Step-by-step migration instructions
- **Architecture Guide**: System design and patterns
- **Deployment Guide**: Production deployment instructions

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

- **Performance**: Reduced response times through service optimization
- **Scalability**: Independent service scaling based on demand
- **Maintainability**: Easier debugging and feature development
- **Reliability**: Fault isolation and service resilience
