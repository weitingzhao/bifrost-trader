I have successfully consolidated all migration and refactoring files from the knowledge base into one comprehensive guide:

### **✅ New Consolidated File**

### **🎯 Usage with Cursor AI**
Reference the consolidated guide:
```
"Based on COMPREHENSIVE_MIGRATION_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md, how should I migrate the Portfolio Service from Smart Trader?"

"According to COMPREHENSIVE_MIGRATION_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md, what's the migration status of the Data Service?"

"Using COMPREHENSIVE_MIGRATION_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md as reference, help me implement the Execution Service migration from Smart Trader."
```

### **🗑️ Files Removed**
- `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Consolidated into comprehensive guide
- `REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Consolidated into comprehensive guide

The consolidated guide provides Cursor AI with comprehensive migration and refactoring knowledge in one authoritative source, eliminating the need to reference multiple files for migration decisions.
