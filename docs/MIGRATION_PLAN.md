# Smart Trader to Bifrost Trader Migration Plan

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

**Smart Trader** is a comprehensive Django-based monolithic trading platform that needs to be refactored into **Bifrost Trader**, a modern microservices architecture using FastAPI. This migration plan outlines the systematic approach to decompose the monolithic application into specialized services.
